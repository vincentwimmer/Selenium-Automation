# Selenium-Automation

> Created as a quick learning project to get started with Selenium and Web Automation.
>
> Written in Python 3!

### Required Repos
> - Selenium : https://pypi.org/project/selenium/
> - Chrome-Driver: https://pypi.org/project/chromedriver-binary/#history
>
> **Note** - Be sure to not download a Chrome-Driver newer than your current Chrome version : chrome://settings/help

### How-To Setup:
> - First pip the repos from above.
> - Next download: **Automation.py** and **login.txt**
> - Put these files where you want to work with them and update file paths on **lines 32 and 53**

Once everything is set up, you can run the code and it will dump a CSV file filled with data from the website.

### \*Extra\* How-To Get XPaths:
> - Right-Click and Inspect the element you want to find. If you already have the Inspector open, it will scroll to and highlight the element.
